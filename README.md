# üìö Code Documentation

## Packages Used

AdSnap Studio relies on the following main Python packages:

- **streamlit**: For building the interactive web application interface.
- **requests**: For making HTTP requests to Bria AI's APIs and other endpoints.
- **python-dotenv**: For loading environment variables (such as API keys) from a `.env` file.
- **Pillow (PIL)**: For image processing and manipulation.
- **python-magic**: For file type detection.
- **streamlit-drawable-canvas**: For enabling users to draw masks and annotations directly on images within the Streamlit app.
- **numpy**: For numerical operations, especially with image arrays.

## How AdSnap Studio Works

AdSnap Studio is a Streamlit-based application designed to help users generate professional product advertisements using Bria AI's advanced image generation and manipulation APIs. Here‚Äôs a high-level overview of its workflow:

1. **User Input**: Users can enter a product description (text prompt) or upload a product image.
2. **Configuration**: Users can configure options in the sidebar, such as:
   - Enhancing prompts with AI
   - Removing backgrounds
   - Adding realistic shadows
   - Creating lifestyle shots (placing products in context)
   - Adding call-to-action (CTA) text overlays
   - Adjusting advanced settings (background color, shadow intensity, etc.)
3. **Image Generation**:
   - The app calls Bria AI APIs to generate HD product images, create lifestyle shots, add shadows, or remove backgrounds based on user input and configuration.
   - Users can use a drawable canvas to mask areas for generative fill or erasure.
4. **Result Display**:
   - Generated images are displayed in the app.
   - Users can download the results directly.
5. **Session Management**:
   - The app uses Streamlit‚Äôs session state to manage API keys, generated images, and user settings across interactions.

## Main Components

- **app.py**: The main entry point, handling the UI, user interactions, and orchestrating calls to service functions.
- **services/**: Contains modules for each image manipulation feature (e.g., `packshot`, `lifestyle_shot`, `generative_fill`, etc.), each wrapping a Bria AI API endpoint.
- **components/sidebar.py**: Handles the sidebar configuration UI and collects user preferences.
- **workflows/**: Contains higher-level workflows that combine multiple services for more complex ad generation.

## Example Workflow

1. User uploads a product image and enters a description.
2. User selects "Create Packshot" and configures background color.
3. The app sends the image and options to the Bria API via the `create_packshot` service.
4. The processed image is returned and displayed for download.

## Environment Setup

- The app requires a `.env` file with your Bria API key:
  ```
  BRIA_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
  ```

# üìù app.py ‚Äî Main Application Script Documentation

## Overview

`app.py` is the main entry point for AdSnap Studio. It is responsible for initializing the Streamlit web interface, managing user sessions, and orchestrating all image generation and editing workflows by integrating with Bria AI APIs and internal service modules.

---

## Structure & Main Phases

### 1. Imports and Setup

- **Imports**: Loads essential libraries for UI (`streamlit`), environment management (`os`, `dotenv`), image processing (`PIL`, `numpy`), HTTP requests (`requests`), and custom services from the `services` module.
- **Page Configuration**: Sets up the Streamlit page (title, icon, layout).
- **Environment Variables**: Loads the Bria API key and other environment variables using `python-dotenv`.

### 2. Session State Initialization

- **Function:** `initialize_session_state()`
  - Initializes Streamlit's session state variables to persist user data and app state across interactions.
  - Example variables: `api_key`, `generated_images`, `current_image`, `pending_urls`, `edited_image`, `original_prompt`, `enhanced_prompt`.

### 3. Utility Functions

- **`download_image(url)`**: Downloads an image from a URL and returns it as bytes.
- **`apply_image_filter(image, filter_type)`**: Applies filters (Grayscale, Sepia, High Contrast, Blur) to an image using PIL.
- **`check_generated_images()`**: Checks if images at `pending_urls` are ready (HTTP 200) and updates the session state.
- **`auto_check_images(status_container)`**: Automatically checks for image completion a few times, updating the UI status.

### 4. Main Application Logic

- **Function:** `main()`
  - Builds the Streamlit UI and handles user interaction.
  - **Sidebar**: Lets users input their Bria API key.
  - **Tabs**: The app is organized into four main tabs:
    1. **Generate Image**: Generate product images from text prompts.
    2. **Lifestyle Shot**: Create lifestyle/contextual images from product images.
    3. **Generative Fill**: Inpaint or fill masked areas in images.
    4. **Erase Elements**: Remove unwanted elements from images.

## Detailed Functionality by Tab

### 1. üé® Generate Image Tab

- **Prompt Input**: Users enter a text prompt describing the desired product image.
- **Prompt Enhancement**: Option to enhance the prompt using Bria AI (`enhance_prompt`).
- **Image Generation**: Calls `generate_hd_image` service with the prompt and user settings (number of images, aspect ratio, style, etc.).
- **Result Display**: Shows generated images and allows download.

### 2. üñºÔ∏è Lifestyle Shot Tab

- **Image Upload**: Users upload a product image.
- **Edit Options**: Choose between creating a packshot, adding a shadow, or generating a lifestyle shot.
- **Packshot**: Calls `create_packshot` service to generate a professional product image with a clean background.
- **Shadow**: Calls `add_shadow` service to add realistic shadows.
- **Lifestyle Shot**: Calls `lifestyle_shot_by_text` or `lifestyle_shot_by_image` to place the product in a contextual scene.

### 3. üé® Generative Fill Tab

- **Image Upload & Masking**: Users upload an image and draw a mask over the area to be filled.
- **Prompt Input**: Describe what should appear in the masked area.
- **Generative Fill**: Calls `generative_fill` service to inpaint the masked region using AI.
- **Result Display**: Shows the filled images and allows download.

### 4. üé® Erase Elements Tab

- **Image Upload & Masking**: Users upload an image and draw over elements to erase.
- **Erase Foreground**: Calls `erase_foreground` service to remove the selected elements and reconstruct the background.
- **Result Display**: Shows the edited images and allows download.

---

## Key Functions and Their Roles

- **`main()`**: Orchestrates the UI, tab navigation, and user interaction.
- **`initialize_session_state()`**: Ensures all necessary session variables are set.
- **`download_image(url)`**: Utility for fetching images from URLs.
- **`apply_image_filter(image, filter_type)`**: Applies visual effects to images.

## Example Code Snippet: Session State Initialization

```python
# In app.py
def initialize_session_state():
    if 'api_key' not in st.session_state:
        st.session_state.api_key = os.getenv('BRIA_API_KEY')
    if 'generated_images' not in st.session_state:
        st.session_state.generated_images = []
    # ... (other session variables)
```

## How to Extend or Modify

- To add new image editing features, implement a new service in the `services/` directory and add a corresponding UI section in `app.py`.
- To change the UI, modify the relevant tab or sidebar code in `main()`.
